                <h1>About Oxford House</h1>

                <h2>The Oxford House Model</h2>
                <p>All Oxford Houses have common characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Democratically Managed:</strong> The houses are managed democratically by the residents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Responsibility:</strong> House members are responsible for most household expenses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sobriety Enforcement:</strong> Any member who uses alcohol or drugs must be immediately expelled.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chartered Membership:</strong> Each house must fulfill these guidelines to be a chartered member of Oxford House, Inc., a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each house represents an effective and low-cost method of preventing relapse and encouraging emotional growth. The standardized system for Oxford House has evolved since the first house opened in 1975 and has grown to over 2,865 houses nationwide. All Oxford Houses in Kansas are linked together by chapters to ensure mutual support.</p>

                <h2>What Do Oxford Houses Offer?</h2>
                <p>Oxford House offers a supportive way of living and opportunities to learn skills in a clean and sober environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Residents receive 24-hour support from peers in recovery.</li>
                    <li>Learn alcohol and drug-free living skills.</li>
                    <li>Share responsibility for maintaining the house.</li>
                    <li>Vote on all issues affecting the house.</li>
                    <li>Elect house officers responsible for guiding and managing the house.</li>
                    <li>Receive guidelines and training to successfully manage a house.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Having houses in good neighborhoods with a safe environment for recovery to flourish may be the single most important reason for Oxford House's success. Using this cost-effective way to improve the chances of recovery from addiction shows the community that recovery works and that recovering addicts can become model citizens. Oxford Houses have an 80% success rate nationally.</p>

                <h2>What Makes It Work?</h2>
                <p>The <strong>men and women</strong> who make Oxford Houses their home make it work!</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional halfway houses, there are no staff. An Oxford House is a self-run and self-supported recovery house. The concept is the same that underlies 12-step programs: addicted individuals help themselves by helping each other abstain from alcohol and drug use one day at a time.</p>
                <p>Residents assume and learn responsibility for their recovery. Additionally, there are no time limits. This allows individuals to focus on establishing a new set of personal values centered around sobriety. It allows them to practice the skills of responsible family and community living with their new Oxford House family.</p>

                <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each individual must be willing to accept house rules.</li>
                    <li>Each individual must be able to pay their share of the house expenses, which includes holding a job and/or doing service work, such as education or community service.</li>
                    <li>Each individual must have the desire to work on their recovery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Apply for Membership</h2>
                <p>Individuals apply directly to the house of their choice. If there are no vacancies, an individual may be referred to another house in the area.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Call the house to schedule an interview.</li>
                    <li>Show up on time for an interview by members of the house, complete an application, and submit it to the house.</li>
                    <li>An 80% yes vote is required for acceptance.</li>
                </ol>
