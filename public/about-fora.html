                    <h1>Friends of Recovery Association</h1>
                    <p>FORA, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has been advocating for Oxford Houses, transitional housing for people in recovery from drugs and alcohol, in Kansas since 1991.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are 159 houses in Kansas (as of August 2022).</li>
                        <li>FORA provides the start-up loan for all new houses in Kansas.</li>
                        <li>FORA provides mentoring, crisis intervention, conflict mediation, community liaison work, and landlord negotiations.</li>
                        <li>FORA has helped thousands of individuals in recovery break away from the destructive pattern of addiction and become productive members of their communities.</li>
                        <li>According to a DePaul study, people who stay in an Oxford House for 15 months have an 80% success rate of still being clean and sober in 5 years.</li>
                        <li>FORA helps families stay together by establishing houses for men with children and women with children.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Friends of Recovery Association's mission is to support and collaborate with Oxford Houses in Kansas, which are self-supporting, democratically-operated homes for recovering individuals. Friends of Recovery and Oxford Houses assist service participants to attain and sustain recovery from substance addiction.</p>

                    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>Our vision is to have an Oxford House for every recovering individual in Kansas.</p>

                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Friends of Recovery was started in 1991 by a task force formed at Asbury United Methodist Church, headed by Ed Stephenson and Harold and Ruth Keeling. Mr. Stephenson brought Oxford House founder Paul Molloy back to Kansas, where the first Oxford House was opened and is still open today, as Oxford House Santa Fe in Overland Park, Kansas.</p>

                    <h2>The Oxford House Program</h2>
                    <p>Oxford Houses are transitional living for people in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction. The houses are not a boarding house or a halfway house, but a home run democratically by the service participants themselves. If everyone pays their own way, does not drink or use, and abides by the democratic process, they may stay in an Oxford House as long as they wish.</p>

                    <h2>Friends of Recovery Programs</h2>
                    <p>Friends of Recovery (FORA) is the outreach organization supporting the Oxford Houses in Kansas. FORA programs include opening new Oxford Houses with federal block grant money, mediating in houses, case management, and education.</p>

                    <h2>Opening New Houses</h2>
                    <p>Paul Molloy, using his influence with Capitol Hill, helped establish start-up loans for Oxford Houses worldwide. In 1988, Congress enacted P.L. 100-690, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act. This Act included a provision that required all states to establish a revolving loan fund to provide startup funds for groups wishing to open sober living environments based on the Oxford House model. The mandate was changed in 1990 to a permissive provision codified as 42 USC 300x-25.</p>
                    <p>Kansas has had a revolving loan fund for Kansas Oxford Houses since 1993. A new house applies for the loan through FORA, which works with the chapter to open the new Oxford House.</p>

                    <h2>Case Management</h2>
                    <p>Oxford Houses' case management includes attending house and chapter meetings, mediating disagreements between house members, landlords, or neighbors. Monthly New Member orientations help Oxford House service participants understand the principles and traditions of Oxford House. Alumni, Chapters, and Friends of Recovery offer workshops focusing on house officers, communications, and trauma-informed care.</p>
