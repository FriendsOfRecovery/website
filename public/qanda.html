                        <p>
                            A good place to start is with a drug and alcohol assessment. Heartland Regional Alcohol and Drug Assessment Center can answer questions about cost, appointments, etc. Their website is <a href="https://www.hradac.com/" target="_blank">www.hradac.com</a>.

                        <h3>I have a house that I would like to make an Oxford House. What is the criteria and process?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Oxford Houses are located in good neighborhoods—that is the first criterion. The house needs to accommodate at least six individuals, so it should have adequate space. Four or more bedrooms and at least two bathrooms are important. If you think your house might fit this description, please contact us. We would be happy to talk with you about it!

                                    College students are using drugs and alcohol at a higher rate than young adults of the same age who don’t attend school. <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/alcohol-facts-and-statistics" target="_blank">A recent study</a> from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicated that more than half of full-time college students ages 18-22 drank alcohol in the past month.
